# Red Wine Quality Analysis

This repository was created as part of IEEE Club recruitment task for Computer Society Domain.
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. Detailed information about the dataset can be found below.

For the analysis of the fixed acidity, alcohol content, pH value, and other parameters, NumPy and Python Pandas were used.There are also graphs in the repository that depict some of the column values.
## About Dataset
The dataset is related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).

This dataset is also available from the UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
